## üß† Engineering Logic Overview

### Wind Pressure Calculation (ASCE 7)
```typescript
// Velocity pressure calculation
const qh = 0.00256 * Kh * Kzt * Kd * I * V¬≤

// Zone pressure coefficients (uplift/suction)
const GCp = {
  zone1Field: -0.9,      // Field areas
  zone1Perimeter: -1.4,  // Inner perimeter
  zone2Perimeter: -2.0,  // Outer perimeter  
  zone3Corner: -2.8      // Critical corner zones
}
```

### Template Selection Decision Tree
```
IF project_type == "recover"
  IF membrane_thickness >= 80mil OR wind_pressure > 35psf
    ‚Üí T5 Recover Fleeceback (Induction Welded)
  ELSE  
    ‚Üí T4 Standard Recover (Mechanically Attached)

IF hvhz == true
  ‚Üí Add NOA requirements
  ‚Üí Enhanced fastening patterns
  ‚Üí Third-party inspection protocols
```

### Fastening Pattern Optimization
```typescript
// Base patterns adjusted by wind pressure and template
if (maxPressure > 50) {
  fieldSpacing = "8\" o.c.";
  perimeterSpacing = "3\" o.c."; 
  cornerSpacing = "2\" o.c.";
}

// HVHZ enhancements
if (hvhz) {
  fieldSpacing = reduceSpacing(fieldSpacing, 1);
  // Additional requirements per TAS 105
}
```

## üèÜ Key Achievement

‚úÖ **Complete Engineering Transparency**: The engineering summary metadata provides a full audit trail of every decision made during SOW generation, from jurisdiction mapping through wind analysis to fastening specifications. This addresses the core requirement for auditability while maintaining user-friendly operation.

The system successfully bridges complex engineering calculations with intuitive user experience, making professional SOW generation accessible to roofing contractors while maintaining the technical rigor required for commercial projects.

**Built with ‚ù§Ô∏è for the roofing industry**

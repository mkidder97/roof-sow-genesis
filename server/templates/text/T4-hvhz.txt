# **SOW TEMPLATE T4 - HVHZ RECOVER SYSTEM**

## High Velocity Hurricane Zone Project
This project involves a **{{selectedSystem}}** HVHZ-compliant roof recover system installed over the existing roof assembly at {{projectAddress}}. This system has been specifically engineered to meet High Velocity Hurricane Zone requirements per {{jurisdictionNotes}}.

## HVHZ Compliance Requirements
- **NOA/ESR Required**: {{noaRequired}}
- **Enhanced Wind Resistance**: Designed for {{windSpeed}} mph basic wind speed
- **Special Inspection**: Required throughout installation
- **{{codeCycle}}** compliance with HVHZ provisions

## Scope of Work
The scope of work includes:
- Installation of NOA-approved {{selectedSystem}} membrane system
- Enhanced {{fasteningSpecs}} attachment patterns exceeding standard requirements
- HVHZ-compliant flashing and accessory details
- Special inspection and documentation throughout project
- Compliance with {{asceVersion}} enhanced wind load requirements

## Template Selection Rationale
{{rationale}}

## Enhanced Wind Load Requirements (HVHZ)
**HVHZ Wind Analysis**: {{windCalculationSummary}}

Enhanced zone pressure requirements:
{{zonePressureDetails}}

**Critical Design Factors**:
- Enhanced safety factors applied
- Special exposure considerations
- Coastal wind characteristics included

## Enhanced Fastening Specifications
**Field Area**: {{fieldSpacing}} (Enhanced for HVHZ)
**Perimeter Area**: {{perimeterSpacing}} (Enhanced for HVHZ)  
**Corner Area**: {{cornerSpacing}} (Enhanced for HVHZ)
**Fastener Type**: {{fastenerType}} (HVHZ Approved)
**Penetration Depth**: {{penetrationDepth}}

## HVHZ Special Requirements

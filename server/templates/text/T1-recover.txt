# **SOW TEMPLATE T1 - RECOVER SYSTEM**

## Project Overview
This project involves a **{{selectedSystem}}** roof recover system installed over the existing roof assembly at {{projectAddress}}. The recover system has been engineered to meet {{asceVersion}} wind load requirements with {{jurisdictionNotes}}.

## Scope of Work
The scope of work includes:
- Installation of new {{selectedSystem}} membrane system
- {{fasteningSpecs}} attachment patterns to meet {{zonePressures}} wind uplift requirements  
- All necessary flashing and accessory work
- Compliance with {{codeCycle}} and applicable building codes

## Template Selection Rationale
{{rationale}}

## Wind Load Requirements

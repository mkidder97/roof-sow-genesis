# **SOW TEMPLATE T6 - STEEP SLOPE SYSTEM**

## Steep Slope Project Overview
This project involves a **{{selectedSystem}}** steep slope roof system ({{roofSlope}} slope) at {{projectAddress}}. The system has been engineered specifically for steep slope applications to meet {{asceVersion}} wind load and drainage requirements.

## Steep Slope Requirements
- **Slope**: {{roofSlope}} (â‰¥ 2:12 threshold)
- **Enhanced Drainage**: Designed for rapid water shedding
- **Specialized Attachment**: Steep slope fastening patterns
- **Wind Uplift**: {{zonePressures}} with slope-adjusted coefficients

## Scope of Work
The scope of work includes:
- Installation of steep slope {{selectedSystem}} membrane system
- Specialized {{fasteningSpecs}} attachment for steep applications
- Enhanced drainage and water management details
- Steep slope-specific flashing and termination details
- Compliance with steep slope provisions of {{codeCycle}}

## Template Selection Rationale

**Steep Slope Factors**:
- Increased wind loading on steep surfaces
- Enhanced drainage requirements
- Specialized installation procedures

## Specialized Fastening for Steep Slope
**Field Area**: {{fieldSpacing}} (Slope-adjusted pattern)
**Perimeter Area**: {{perimeterSpacing}} (Enhanced for steep slope)
**Corner Area**: {{cornerSpacing}} (Critical steep slope areas)
**Fastener Type**: {{fastenerType}} (Steep slope rated)
**Penetration Depth**: {{penetrationDepth}}

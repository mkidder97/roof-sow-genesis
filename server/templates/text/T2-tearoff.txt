# **SOW TEMPLATE T2 - TEAR-OFF SYSTEM**

## Complete Tear-Off Project
This project involves complete tear-off and replacement with a **{{selectedSystem}}** roof system at {{projectAddress}}. The new system has been engineered to meet {{asceVersion}} wind load requirements and {{codeCycle}} compliance.

## Project Scope Overview
- **Complete Removal**: All existing roof materials to structural deck
- **New System Installation**: {{selectedSystem}} with {{fasteningSpecs}} specifications
- **Enhanced Performance**: Designed to exceed {{zonePressures}} wind requirements
- **Code Compliance**: {{codeCycle}} and applicable building codes

## Scope of Work
The scope of work includes:
- Complete removal of existing roof system to structural deck
- Deck inspection and preparation as required
- Installation of new {{selectedSystem}} membrane system
- {{fasteningSpecs}} attachment patterns to meet {{zonePressures}} requirements
- New flashing and accessory installation throughout
- Compliance with {{asceVersion}} wind load calculations

## Template Selection Rationale
{{rationale}}

## Wind Load Requirements

## New System Fastening Specifications
**Field Area**: {{fieldSpacing}} (New installation)
**Perimeter Area**: {{perimeterSpacing}} (New installation)
**Corner Area**: {{cornerSpacing}} (New installation)
**Fastener Type**: {{fastenerType}} (New system)
**Penetration Depth**: {{penetrationDepth}}

## Tear-Off Special Considerations
- Weather protection during tear-off phases
- Coordinated utility disconnections and reconnections
- Debris removal and disposal procedures
- Phased installation to minimize building exposure
- {{specialRequirements}}

## New System Benefits
- Complete warranty coverage for entire roof system
- Enhanced energy efficiency with new insulation
- Improved drainage and water management
- Updated compliance with current building codes
- Long-term performance reliability

## System Compliance

## Quality Assurance - New Installation
- Complete inspection of structural deck condition
- New system installation per manufacturer specifications
- Enhanced quality control for all new components
- Final inspection with complete system verification
- Full warranty coverage for new installation

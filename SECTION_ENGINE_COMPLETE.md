# SECTION ENGINE & SELF-HEALING IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

## üéØ IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

Successfully implemented the **Section Engine** and **Self-Healing Logic** to complete the intelligent SOW generator. The system now dynamically selects paragraph sections and applies intelligent corrections with full transparency.

## üß© NEW COMPONENTS IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Section Engine (`section-engine.ts`)
- **Dynamic Paragraph Mapping**: Analyzes project data and selects appropriate SOW sections
- **Content Generation**: Creates full paragraph content for each included section
- **Logic-Based Selection**: Uses rules-based system for inclusion/exclusion decisions
- **Priority Ordering**: Sections are ordered by importance and dependencies

**Key Features:**
- ‚úÖ Base scope (always included)
- ‚úÖ System specifications and wind analysis
- ‚úÖ Conditional sections (fall protection, expansion joints, demolition, crickets, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Flashing sections (parapet, coping, penetrations)
- ‚úÖ Compliance sections (HVHZ, special requirements)
- ‚úÖ Quality and warranty sections

### 2. Self-Healing Logic
- **Input Validation & Correction**: Automatically fixes missing or invalid data
- **Intelligent Defaults**: Provides reasonable fallbacks when data is incomplete
- **Confidence Scoring**: Tracks reliability of corrections
- **Impact Assessment**: Categorizes corrections by potential impact
- **User Review Flags**: Identifies when human review is recommended

**Self-Healing Actions:**
- üîß Missing field corrections (deck type, exposure category, etc.)
- üîß Takeoff data estimation based on building characteristics
- üîß Auto-correction with confidence tracking
- üîß Fallback selection when primary data unavailable

### 3. Enhanced Types (`types/index.ts`)
- **SectionOutput**: Individual section definition with content and rationale
- **SectionAnalysis**: Complete section selection results
- **SelfHealingAction**: Detailed correction tracking
- **SelfHealingReport**: Comprehensive healing summary

### 4. Updated SOW Generator (`sow-generator.ts`)
- **Integrated Section Engine**: Step 8 in generation pipeline
- **Self-Healing Pipeline**: Input validation and correction throughout
- **Enhanced Engineering Summary**: Includes section analysis and healing report
- **Debug Tracing**: Full transparency on section decisions

### 5. Enhanced API Endpoints (`routes/sow-enhanced.ts`)
- **`/debug-sow`**: Complete engineering summary with section analysis
- **`/debug-sections`**: Detailed section mapping and reasoning
- **`/debug-self-healing`**: Self-healing actions and recommendations
- **`/debug-engine-trace`**: Updated to include section engine
- **`/render-template`**: Enhanced with dynamic section injection

## üìã SECTION MAPPING RULES IMPLEMENTED

| Section ID | Include If | Description |
|------------|------------|-------------|
| `fall_protection` | `fall_protection_required = true` OR `building_height > 30` OR `roof_hatches > 0` | OSHA fall protection requirements |
| `expansion_joints` | `expansion_joints > 0` | Expansion joint treatment and flashing |
| `demolition` | `project_type = "tearoff"` | Existing roof system removal |
| `crickets` | `roof_slope < 0.25` OR high drain density | Drainage improvements |
| `scupper_mods` | `scuppers > 0` | Scupper modifications and flashing |
| `coping_detail` | `parapet_height > 18` | Metal coping on tall parapets |
| `hvac_controls` | `hvac_units > 0` | HVAC coordination |
| `walkway_pads` | `walkway_pad_requested = true` OR `hvac_units > 0` | Traffic protection |
| `special_coordination` | `sensitive_tenants = true` OR `shared_parking_access = true` | Enhanced coordination |

## üîß SELF-HEALING EXAMPLES

### Missing Field Healing
```typescript
// Input: deckType = undefined
// Action: Assumed steel deck (most common)
// Confidence: 70%
// Impact: Medium
```

### Takeoff Data Estimation
```typescript
// Input: No takeoff provided
// Action: Generated intelligent estimates based on:
//   - Drains: 1 per 10,000 sq ft
//   - Penetrations: Based on building size
//   - HVAC: Based on building area
// Confidence: 40% (requires user review)
```

### Auto-Correction
```typescript
// Input: membraneMaterial = undefined
// Action: Used membraneType value
// Confidence: 90%
// Impact: Low
```

## üß™ TESTING & DEBUG CAPABILITIES

### Debug SOW Endpoint
```bash
POST /api/sow/debug-sow
# Returns complete engineering summary with:
# - Section analysis (included/excluded with rationale)
# - Self-healing report (actions and confidence)
# - All engine traces
```

### Section Analysis Debug
```bash
POST /api/sow/debug-sections
# Returns detailed section mapping:
# - Decision matrix
# - Content generation trace
# - Confidence scoring
```

### Self-Healing Debug
```bash
POST /api/sow/debug-self-healing
# Returns healing analysis:
# - All corrections made
# - Confidence levels
# - User review requirements
```

## üìä TRANSPARENCY & EXPLAINABILITY

### Section Analysis Block
```typescript
sectionAnalysis: {
  includedSections: [
    {
      id: "fall_protection",
      title: "Fall Protection Requirements", 
      rationale: "Building height requires fall protection",
      priority: 5,
      content: "Contractor shall furnish temporary OSHA-compliant..."
    }
  ],
  excludedSections: [
    {
      id: "scupper_mods",
      title: "Scupper Modifications",
      rationale: "No scuppers present"
    }
  ],
  reasoningMap: { ... },
  selfHealingActions: [ ... ],
  confidenceScore: 0.85
}
```

### Self-Healing Report
```typescript
selfHealingReport: {
  totalActions: 3,
  highImpactActions: [
    {
      type: "missing_field",
      field: "exposureCategory", 
      correctedValue: "C",
      reason: "Exposure not specified, assumed suburban",
      confidence: 0.6,
      impact: "high"
    }
  ],
  recommendations: ["Verify exposure category for accuracy"],
  overallConfidence: 0.75,
  requiresUserReview: true
}
```

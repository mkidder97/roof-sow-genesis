## 🚀 New Professional Endpoint

### **`POST /api/engineering-preview`**
Complete engineering intelligence for professional review:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/engineering-preview \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "address": "2650 NW 89th Ct, Doral, FL 33172",
    "projectType": "recover",
    "membraneType": "TPO Fleeceback"
  }'
